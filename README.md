# Crypto Currency Full Stack App (Completed)

This project was developed solo, although it may appear as co-authored due to providing VS Code live access share to a friend for source code viewing purposes.
The application is designed to provide real-time data for various cryptocurrencies, utilizing CoinGecko API endpoints. It features a custom Python GUI with login/registration authentication management.
